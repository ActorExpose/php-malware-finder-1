# PHP Malware Finder release documentation

## What should I do before releasing ?

Thou shalt test your modifications. If everything goes fine, you should see this
message:
```
$ ./tests.sh 
[+] Congratz, the 54 tests succeeded!
```

Otherwise, your modifications introduced a regression, check how to fix this,
then test again until all tests pass.

## OK, it's done, how do I release my new PMF version now ?

First, make sure enough modifications have been made to warrant a new release.
Since PMF provides its own debian package files, you can build a package,
hence need to modify the changelog file to add an entry in the debian/changelog
file:

```
nbs-phpmalwarefinder (X.Y.Z-T~deb##version+nbsYYYMMDD) distrib; urgency=XXX

  * new feature
  * bug fix
  * moar documentation

 -- yournick <your@email.com>  `date -R`
```

Then you can commit on our git repository:
```
$ git commit -am "my changes"
$ git tag X.Y.Z
$ git push
```
