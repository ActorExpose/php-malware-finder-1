# PHP Malware Finder release documentation

## What should I do before releasing?

Thou shalt test your modifications. If everything goes fine, you should see this
message:

```
$ make test 
[+] Congratz, the XX tests succeeded!
```

Otherwise, your modifications introduced a regression, fix them,
then **test again** until all tests are passing.

## OK, it's done, how do I release my new PMF version now?

First, make sure enough modifications have been made to warrant a new release.
Since PMF provides its own debian package files, you may build a package,
hence the need to modify the changelog file to add an entry in the
`debian/changelog` file:

You should use the `dch -i` command instead of editing the changelog by hand,
but if you don't have it installed, you can add something like this:

```
nbs-phpmalwarefinder (X.Y.Z-T~deb##version+nbsYYYMMDD) distrib; urgency=XXX

  * new feature
  * bug fix
  * moar documentation

 -- yournick <your@email.com>  `date -R`
```

Then you can commit on our git repository:

```
$ git commit -am "X.Y.Z"
$ git tag X.Y.Z
$ git push --tags
```

Do not forget to update the [milestones on github](
